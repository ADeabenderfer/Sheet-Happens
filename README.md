| **Project Request**   | During the training phase, the vendor received detailed counts of critical and coaching points of failure for each work item processed. However, upon transitioning to Business As Usual (BAU), the quality reviews were simplified to pass/fail ratings. The vendor has since requested that we reinstate the detailed point counts to enable more granular visibility into their performance improvements at a macro level. Additionally, please update the existing Payroll dashboard to incorporate reporting on these detailed point counts accordingly.                                                          |
| **Opportunities Identified**           | The previously existing vendor dashboard report provided a high-level overview but lacked several critical data points. Consequently, obtaining a more detailed analysis required exporting the data to Excel for further processing. When inquiries were made regarding team or individual analyst performance, the reviewing analysts needed to manually export and manipulate the data on demand. |

| **Future updates pending**           | **Vendor workspace - Turn around time and service level agreement reporting:**<br> Sheets were updated 06.2025 to begin collecting completion dates, hold dates, and calculation columns. Once enough data has been processed within the sheets, the supporting sheets and reports can be made and then added to widgets in the dashboards. <br><br> **New CTQ dashboard for internal employees:**<br> CTQ will be begining for the internal payroll teams and opportunuties were identified between the existing Vendor workspace and the new internal Payroll workspace. (See Opportunities identified and applied for Internal Dashboard). Once the new workspace has become active and data available, reporting will need to be mirrored from the vendor workspace. |

| **Internal Payroll worspaces**   | Within the existing Vendor Payroll Workspace, adding or updating a new analyst, workflow, or dropdown required the administrator to make changes across multiple original and auxiliary sheets to maintain seamless functionality. During the development of reporting solutions within Smartsheet for vendor operations, I identified the capabilities of Data Shuttle. As a result, the new Internal Payroll Workspace has been integrated with a centralized helper sheet managing all dropdown values dynamically, ensuring that updates need to be entered only once, thereby streamlining maintenance and improving efficiency.  |
