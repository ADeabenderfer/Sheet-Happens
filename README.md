| **Project Request**   | During the training phase, the vendor received detailed counts of critical and coaching points of failure for each work item processed. However, upon transitioning to Business As Usual (BAU), the quality reviews were simplified to pass/fail ratings. The vendor has since requested that we reinstate the detailed point counts to enable more granular visibility into their performance improvements at a macro level. Additionally, please update the Payroll dashboard to incorporate reporting on these detailed point counts accordingly.                                                          |
